HomeViewer

This is a web application aimed at allowing users to take a virtual tour of houses and apartments. The site us currently offline due to limited resources but I decided to have the project up on Github.

The project is created on a LAMP stack however once a better solution is found, I intend to make it live. Additionally, the virtual tour is created using Unity3D.
